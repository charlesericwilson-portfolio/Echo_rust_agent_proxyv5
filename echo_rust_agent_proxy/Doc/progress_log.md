  # Echo Rust Agent Proxy - Progress Log (v5)

**Project Phase:** Echo project v5 – Hybrid Tool Calling agent proxy
**Started From:** Reusing core logic from Echo_tmux (v3)  
**Status:** In active testing – Functional but still iterating

## Phase Overview
This version builds directly on the working Rust tmux implementation from **v3 (Echo_tmux)**.  
We kept the proven parts (tmux session management, marker-based output capture, hybrid COMMAND:/SESSION:NAME parsing) and added the missing proxy-like pieces (summarizer integration, cleaner context handling, proper logging) without rebuilding everything from scratch.

### Key Reuse from v3
- tmux session creation/reuse logic (`start_or_reuse_session`)
- Marker-based output capture (`===ECHO_START_` / `===ECHO_END_` timestamps)
- Command execution in named tmux sessions with `send-keys` + `capture-pane`
- Basic session cleanup and error handling
- Hybrid tool calling detection (COMMAND: and SESSION:NAME)

### What Was Added / Changed in v5

**Day 1 – Foundation Reuse**
- Started with the clean v3 `sessions.rs` as base
- Ported the main chat loop and reqwest client from earlier Rust COMMAND version
- Added modular structure (`main.rs` as orchestrator, `sessions.rs`, `commands.rs`, `log.rs`, `safety.rs`)
- Re-integrated the safety deny list (15-item list, checked before every execution)
- Fixed compilation issues from splitting the monolithic file (unused code, Result generics, imports)

**Day 2 – Summarizer Integration**
- Added call to small summarizer model on port 8082 after clean marker capture
- Implemented double-summarization flow: raw tmux output → summarizer → tool message → Echo
- Tuned summarizer prompt for high-signal output (avoided bullet-point over-achievement)
- Confirmed SESSION:NAME works for simple commands (`whoami`, `ls -la`, `ifconfig`)

**Day 3 – Logging & Cleanup**
- JSONL logging in ShareGPT format (user/assistant/tool messages) – already captured 20-30+ examples of when/why to use SESSION vs COMMAND
- Removed or commented unused dead code (old full COMMAND path kept for hybrid support)
- Improved context stripping to reduce repeated tool call issues
- Added proper error messages when deny list blocks a command

**Added Recently**
- Sqlite database support for tool logging and better output capture.
- Added an inner loop to main.rs to allow autonomously chaining tool calls across turns.

### Current Capabilities (v5)
- **COMMAND:** method – Stable, one-shot commands, no summarizer

- **SESSION:NAME** method – Works for persistent tmux sessions (bash, ifconfig, basic msfconsole)

[Session](https://github.com/charlesericwilson-portfolio/Echo_rust_agent_proxyv5/blob/main/echo_rust_agent_proxy/screenshots/ifconfig.png)

- Safety deny list – Active and enforced

- Clean output capture via markers – Only new output returned (big improvement over full session history)

- Summarizer integration – Produces usable high-signal summaries for noisy commands

- JSONL training data generation – Clean logs ready for next LoRA

- Sucessful msf help in persistent tmux session.

### Known Limitations (Honest)
- SESSION method still needs more training examples for complex tools (full msfconsole workflows).

[Difficulty](https://github.com/charlesericwilson-portfolio/Echo_rust_agent_proxyv5/blob/main/echo_rust_agent_proxy/screenshots/llm_being_difficult.png)

- Context pollution / repeated tool calls can still happen occasionally – being tuned.

### Next Planned Steps
- Further refine summarizer prompt and context stripping
- Collect more targeted training examples (SESSION vs COMMAND decision making)
- Test longer msfconsole sessions

**Overall Assessment:**  
v5 is a solid evolution from v3. We reused the best working pieces, added the summarizer and logging cleanly, and kept the code modular. It is **in testing** — functional for daily use and already producing good training data, but not yet perfect for heavy red-team workflows.

This log will be updated as we iterate.
